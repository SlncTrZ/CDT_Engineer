# AutoCAD Provider Tool Guide

> Contract version: `autocad-a1-v1` · Provider version: `0.2.0` · Updated: 2026-09-09

## Runtime scope

The public MCP contract remains the verified **A1 42-tool surface**. `ezdxf` is the default backend.
A staged A2 `com` backend can be selected explicitly on Windows to run the same public A0/A1
operations against live AutoCAD, including native DWG and native plotting.

Backend selection is capability-driven; no silent downgrade is permitted. The staged COM viewport,
live zoom and PNG capture implementation is intentionally not promoted to public MCP tools until the
real Windows + AutoCAD integration lane passes.

## Recommended workflow

1. `system_status` / `system_capabilities`
2. `document_new` or `document_open`
3. optional `transaction_begin`
4. organize with layers/layouts/blocks
5. create/query/modify geometry
6. `transaction_commit` or `transaction_rollback`
7. `document_save` / `document_save_as` / optional `document_export_pdf`

## Identity

- `help` — read-only provider guide and contract fingerprint.
- `system_status` — backend/runtime state, transaction state and COM staging metadata.
- `system_capabilities` — machine-readable capability map for the selected backend.

## Documents

- `document_new`
- `document_open(path)`
- `document_info`
- `document_save(path?)`
- `document_save_as(path)`
- `document_export_pdf(path, layout?)`
- `drawing_audit`
- `drawing_purge`

Backend behavior:

- `ezdxf`: DXF read/write; native DWG is explicitly refused.
- `com`: native AutoCAD DWG/DXF lifecycle; paths still remain inside `CDT_AUTOCAD_ALLOWED_PATHS`.
- `ezdxf` PDF export requires the optional `render` dependency.
- `com` PDF export uses AutoCAD's native `DWG To PDF.pc3` plot path.

The COM backend uses AutoCAD 2018-format SaveAs constants for DWG/DXF, matching the native DWG
format generation used by modern AutoCAD releases. It never writes DXF bytes under a `.dwg` name.

## Query & modification

Read:

- `object_list(type_filter?, layer_filter?, limit=200, offset=0)`
- `object_get(object_id)`
- `object_count(type_filter?, layer_filter?)`

Modify:

- `object_set_properties(object_id, layer?, color?, linetype?, visible?)`
- `object_delete(object_id)`
- `object_move(object_id, dx, dy, dz=0)`
- `object_copy(object_id, dx, dy, dz=0)`
- `object_rotate(object_id, base_x, base_y, angle_deg)`
- `object_scale(object_id, base_x, base_y, factor)`

`object_id` is the native entity handle. List/count operate on the current Model/Paper-space layout.
Explicit layers/linetypes are validated before mutation where the contract requires them.

## Entity creation

- `entity_create_line`
- `entity_create_circle`
- `entity_create_arc`
- `entity_create_polyline`
- `entity_create_text`
- `hatch_create`
- `dimension_linear`
- `dimension_aligned`

Creation targets the current Model/Paper-space layout. COM calls are serialized through one STA
worker so ActiveX operations cannot race each other from concurrent MCP requests.

## Layers

- `layer_list`
- `layer_create(name, color=7)`
- `layer_set_current(name)`

## Blocks

- `block_list`
- `block_create(name, object_ids, base_x=0, base_y=0)`
- `block_insert(name, x, y, scale_x=1, scale_y=1, rotation=0, layer?)`

All source handles resolve before a new block definition is created. The COM path removes a partial
block definition if `CopyObjects` fails.

## Layouts / paper space

- `layout_list`
- `layout_create(name)`
- `layout_set_current(name)`

Layout names resolve case-insensitively. Creation/query operations follow the active layout.

A2 backend code also stages native viewport create/list/scale/lock/delete. Those methods are not yet
part of `autocad-a1-v1`; they become public only after live AutoCAD verification and the subsequent
contract/version decision.

## Transactions / undo

- `transaction_begin`
- `transaction_commit`
- `transaction_rollback`
- `undo`
- `redo`

`ezdxf` uses compressed bounded snapshots. `com` uses native AutoCAD undo marks. COM additionally
tracks the active document: switching documents while a tracked transaction is open is refused, so a
commit cannot accidentally close an undo mark in the wrong drawing.

A timed-out COM mutation is fundamentally different from a timed-out headless worker: the abandoned
STA call cannot be force-cancelled and **may still complete in AutoCAD**. The provider marks that state
uncertain and warns against blind retry because a retry can double-apply the mutation.

## Backend configuration

```text
CDT_AUTOCAD_BACKEND             ezdxf (default) | com
CDT_AUTOCAD_COM_PROGID          default AutoCAD.Application
CDT_AUTOCAD_COM_ATTACH_POLICY   attach_only (default) | attach_or_start
CDT_AUTOCAD_COM_TIMEOUT         COM deadline in seconds; default 60
```

`attach_only` is fail-closed: if no matching application is already running, the provider refuses
rather than starting AutoCAD. `attach_or_start` must be chosen explicitly.

The `com` optional dependency installs pywin32 plus Pillow; Pillow is used only by the staged native
window PNG capture path.

## Security / reliability

- File operations are contained to `CDT_AUTOCAD_ALLOWED_PATHS`.
- Input CAD size is bounded by `CDT_AUTOCAD_MAX_DXF_BYTES` at the current provider boundary.
- Headless calls use `CDT_AUTOCAD_CALL_TIMEOUT`; render/PDF calls use `CDT_AUTOCAD_RENDER_TIMEOUT`.
- Live COM calls use the separate `CDT_AUTOCAD_COM_TIMEOUT`.
- COM is lazy-attached and single-STA-thread serialized.
- Unknown/pre-existing live viewports are not deleted by staged A2 code unless `force=true`, because
  ActiveX exposes no reliable main-viewport predicate.
- HTTP transport requires `CDT_AUTOCAD_AUTH_TOKEN`; remote HTTP also requires explicit opt-in.
- Credentials are never returned by tools.
- No arbitrary AutoLISP, shell, macro or free-text command execution is exposed.

## Current explicit limitations

Public `autocad-a1-v1` still does not expose:

- viewport management / live zoom / screenshot tools (A2 code staged, live verification pending);
- angular/radius/diameter dimensions;
- advanced hatch editing/gradients;
- trim/offset/fillet;
- GDT;
- ACIS 3D solids.

A2 is not CLOSED until the opt-in Windows + real AutoCAD lane validates native DWG, A0/A1 parity,
viewport operations, zoom and PNG capture. A3 owns the advanced drafting/engineering families.
